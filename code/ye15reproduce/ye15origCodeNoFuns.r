#### README
# The following code is intended for use with the R programming language. No conversion is necessary.
#
# The remaining dataset files will require conversion to .csv format. This can be done using Excel's "save as .csv" command. The expected datafiles are:
# "Dataset S1.xls" ---> "sockeye_ret_data.csv"
# "Dataset S2.xls" ---> "sockeye_data.csv"
# "Dataset S3.xls" ---> "env_data.csv"
