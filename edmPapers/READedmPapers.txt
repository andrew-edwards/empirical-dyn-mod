READedmPapers.txt 13/4/16.

When adding papers to be shared, please use the following filename format:

surnameXXkeyword.pdf

surname - surname of lead author (lower case)
XX - two digits for the year
keyword - something short that says what the paper is about (lower case, 
 upper case for start of a second word). 

e.g.

ye15calCofi.pdf - 2015 paper, first author Ye, to do with the Cal Cofi data.  

We may get duplicates (if people pick different keywords) but they will be easy
 to spot and tidy up.
